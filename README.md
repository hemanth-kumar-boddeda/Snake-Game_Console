<h1>C++ Snake Game</h1>


This is a simple terminal-based Snake game implemented in C++. The game is played in a grid of characters, with the snake represented by the character 'O' and the fruit represented by the character 'F'.



<h1>How to play</h1>
The game can be controlled using the 'a', 'd', 'w', and 's' keys to move the snake in the left, right, up, and down directions, respectively. The game will end when the snake collides with the edges of the playing field or with its own tail. The game can also be exited by pressing the 'x' key.



<h1>Scoring</h1>
The game will keep track of the score, which is increased whenever the snake eats a fruit. The score is displayed at the bottom of the playing field.



<h1>Requirements</h1>
The code uses the <conio.h> and <windows.h> libraries, which are only available on Windows systems. The code was developed and tested using Visual Studio 2019.



<h1>Setup</h1>
Clone the repository to your local machine.
Open the project in Visual Studio.
Build and run the project.
